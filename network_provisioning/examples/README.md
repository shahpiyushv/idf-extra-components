# Provisioning Application Examples

This primarily consists of two examples `wifi_prov` and `thread_prov`, plus `wifi_prov_ext_protocomm`.

* wifi_prov
    Abstracts out most of the complexity of Wi-Fi provisioning and allows easy switching between the SoftAP (using HTTP) and BLE transports. It also demonstrates how applications can register and use additional custom data endpoints.

* thread_prov
    Abstracts out most of the complexity of Thread provisioning over BLE transport. It also demonstrates how applications can register and use additional custom data endpoints.

* wifi_prov_ext_protocomm
    Demonstrates session-only mode, which keeps the protocomm transport alive after provisioning so that the application can reuse the secure session. It also demonstrates session pause and resume, which stop and restart BLE advertising without touching the session.

Provisioning applications are available for `Linux / Windows / macOS` platform as `esp_prov.py` [script](../tool/esp_prov/esp_prov.py)
